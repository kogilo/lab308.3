    // 1. Loop through the string character by character.
    // 2. Store the contents of each cell in a temporary variable.
    // 3. When a comma (,) is encountered, log the cell and reset the temporary variable for the next cell.
    // 4. When the newline sequence (\n) is encountered, treat it as a signal that the row is complete, log the row, and move to the next row.

// Save the string in variable, name `csvString`

// Empty string to store the cell data later
